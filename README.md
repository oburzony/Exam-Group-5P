## Description
This is a simple graphical user interface (GUI) application written in Java using the Swing library. The program allows interactive animation of a red circle moving across a panel. Users can add new red circles by clicking the "Add Circle" button. Additionally, they can add obstacles in the form of black circles at random positions on the panel using the "Add Obstacle" button. The red circle can be controlled using the arrow keys on the keyboard, allowing it to move up, down, left, and right. Upon collision between the red circle and an obstacle (black circle), the red circle is destroyed.
This program provides users with an interactive and dynamic gameplay experience, where the main goal is to avoid collisions and keep the red circle in motion.
